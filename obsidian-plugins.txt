# Obsidian plugins I like to have

## MAKE.md
Quickly generate and maintain an index/overview for a folder or project area.

## Omnisearch
Fast full-text search with better ranking and easier discovery across the vault.

## Excalidraw
Whiteboard-style drawings and diagrams directly inside Obsidian notes.

## Recent Files
A handy list of recently opened notes so you can jump back into what you were working on.

## Tasks
Turns checkboxes into a powerful task system (filters, queries, recurring tasks, due dates).

# Sync plan (data + plugins across devices)

I’m using **Obsidian LiveSync** (self-hosted) to sync my vault between multiple machines without paying for Obsidian Sync.

- **Notes/data:** synced via LiveSync as normal.
- **Plugins & settings:** synced by syncing the `.obsidian` folder (plugin files + configuration), so each device ends up with the same plugin set enabled and configured.
